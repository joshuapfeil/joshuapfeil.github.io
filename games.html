                            <p>My largest scale game project I’ve made on my own.
                                3D procedurally generated mirror maze where you have to bonk into walls to escape.
                                I spent a lot of effort trying to find how to get the reflections right and I eventually
                                discovered that ray tracing is perfect for this use case. I also use my original idea of
                                a reflection probe that sticks to the wall you look at as a fallback.
                            </p> 
                            <p>The graphical and computational complexity of this project made it really fun to make
                                since I had never had a good chance to work on such advanced stuff before.
                                This project took over a year to make with multiple classes dedicated to it.
                                Due to the limited number of objects in the scene, I put a lot of effort into a high
                                quality player character since you will see it throughout the game.

                            <p>While it's not my greatest game nor the funnest, I am still proud of the first game I
                               made during my first year in GIMM. Through this game I learned how to work with Unity, 
                                specifically in 2D. I also learned a lot about art making some of the assets.
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>The game originated from the adorable goat crab hybrid creature I made for another class
                                and decided to reuse it since I was really proud of it.
                                Since I wanted complex animation and interaction with the world, I had to split the
                                character into separate game objects with their own colliders.
                            </p>

                            <p>This game was a group project using Unreal Engine to make a networked multiplayer game.
                                We made a game where players are one of two classes, Merchant or Witch, and their goal is
                                to complete a set of puzzles. The Merchant has an NPC companion that will follow them and
                                follow their orders, while the Witch can ride a broom to "fly" around and can interact at
                                a farther distance.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was in charge of the development side of things, specifically networking, player controllers,
                                puzzle scripts and AI. I also worked on importing our artists' assets, setting up the high
                                quality visuals, shader graphs for texture bombing, and general troubleshooting.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This was my first time working with Unreal Engine and networking, so it was a bit of a challenge,
                                but I learned a lot and I enjoyed working on the project with my team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since I didnt have time during this project to learn C++ and the engine, I used Blueprints 
                                exclusively. However, now that I have experience with Unreal Engine, I think I would be perfectly
                                capable of learning to make a game in C++ with it.
                            </p>
